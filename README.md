# cytc-sequence-analysis
This project demonstrates the usage of Biopython's Seq and SeqRecord classes for analysing the cytochrome c protein sequence. It serves as a practical example to help understand the core concepts of sequence manipulation and analysis in bioinformatics.

## Features

- Fetches cytochrome c protein sequence from NCBI
- Demonstrates various Seq object methods
- Illustrates SeqRecord attributes and annotations
- Shows sequence slicing and manipulation
- Creates and modifies sequence features
- Performs operations on both protein and DNA sequences

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/winniecook/cytc-sequence-analysis.git

## Usage

Run the main script: python3 cytc.py
Install the required packages 
This will perform various operations on the cytochrome c sequence and display the results.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding the Seq class and its methods
- Working with SeqRecord objects and their attributes
- Manipulating biological sequences
- Handling sequence features and annotations
